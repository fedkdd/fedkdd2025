    topic: "PDA: Privacy-preserving Distributed Algorithms and statistical inference in the era of real-world data networks"
    abstract: "With the increasing availability of electronic health records (EHR) data, it is important to effectively integrate evidence from multiple data sources to enable reproducible scientific discovery. However, we are still facing practical challenges in data integration, such as protection of data privacy, the high dimensionality of features, and heterogeneity across different datasets. Aim to facilitate efficient multi-institutional data analysis without sharing individual patient data (IPD), we developed a toolbox of Privacy-preserving Distributed Algorithms (PDA) that conduct distributed learning and inference for various models, such as association analyses, causal inference, cluster analyses, counterfactual analyses, and beyond. Our algorithms do not require iterative communication across sites and are able to account for heterogeneity across different hospitals. The validity and efficiency of PDA are also demonstrated with real-world use cases in Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), PCORnets including PEDSnet and OneFlorida, and Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB)."

    topic: "Local Update Methods for Federated Optimization"
    abstract: "Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm in modern large-scale machine learning. Unlike traditional centralized learning, where models are trained using large datasets stored on a central server, federated learning keeps the training data distributed across many clients, such as phones, network sensors, hospitals, or other local information sources. In this setting, communication-efficient optimization algorithms are crucial. We provide a brief introduction to local update methods developed for federated optimization and discuss their worst-case complexity. Surprisingly, these methods often perform much better in practice than predicted by theoretical analyses using classical assumptions. Recent results show that notions capturing the similarity among client objectives are essential for explaining this improved practical performance."

    topic: "Data-Efficient Federated Learning: Harnessing the Power of Small Data"
    abstract: "Federated Learning (FL) is transforming collaborative and distributed machine learning by enabling multiple clients to train models without the need to share their local data. However, conventional FL frameworks often assume that clients have sufficient data for local model updates, a condition that is rarely met in real-world applications. In many cases, clients have access only to limited or class-imbalanced data, leading to a significant drop in FL performance. This talk will address the challenges of Data-Efficient Federated Learning (DEFL) by exploring strategies to maximize the utility of small datasets within federated environments. We will introduce a novel decoupled meta-learning framework designed for federated settings, which achieves strong performance on new tasks despite limited labeled data. Additionally, we will explore Federated Graph Learning (FGL), a specialized FL approach for graph-structured data distributed across clients. A new framework will be presented that mitigates learning bias for nodes from minority classes, where training data is often scarce. Finally, we will highlight future directions in DEFL, paving the way for more effective and inclusive federated learning systems."

    topic: "Federated Computation Beyond Learning"
    abstract: "The federated model of computation has attracted much interest due to the power of federated learning.  But there is much to do outside of training: federated data preparation and cleaning, post-training federated calibration and monitoring, and federated analytics to track the behaviour.  In this talk, I will touch on the algorithms and systems needed by federated computation, informed by deployment experience."
