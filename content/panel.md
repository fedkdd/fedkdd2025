    title: "University of Virginia"
    topic: "TBD"
    abstract: "TBD"
    bio: "Dr. Jundong Li is an Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia with appointments in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Science, and School of Data Science. Prior to joining UVA, he received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University in 2019, M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at University of Alberta in 2014, and B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2012. His research interests are generally in data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, trustworthy/safe machine learning, causal inference, and, more recently large language models. He has published over 150 papers in high-impact venues and won several prestigious awards, including SIGKDD Best Research Paper Award (2022), PAKDD Best Paper Award (2024), NSF CAREER Award (2022), PAKDD Early Career Research Award (2023), JP Morgan Chase Faculty Research Award (2021 & 2022), and Cisco Faculty Research Award (2021). He has served on the organizing committees of conferences such as KDD, WSDM, SDM, and IEEE BigData, and is currently on the editorial boards for ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) and ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)."

    title: "University of Warwick"
    topic: "Federated Computation Beyond Learning"
    abstract: "The federated model of computation has attracted much interest due to the power of federated learning.  But there is much to do outside of training: federated data preparation and cleaning, post-training federated calibration and monitoring, and federated analytics to track the behaviour.  In this talk, I will touch on the algorithms and systems needed by federated computation, informed by deployment experience."
    bio: "Graham Cormode is a research scientist at Facebook, and a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick in the UK.  His research interests are in data privacy, data stream analysis, massive data sets, and general algorithmic problems. His work on statistical analysis of data has been recognized by the 2017 Adams Prize in Mathematics and as a Fellow of the ACM."
